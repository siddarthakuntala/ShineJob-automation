Shine.com Job Application Automation (Maven Project)
This project automates the process of logging into Shine.com, searching for jobs, and applying to a selected job using Selenium WebDriver in Java. It simulates a complete job search experience, from login to job application, making it ideal for demonstrating real-world browser automation.

üìå Features
Automated Login: Automatically logs in to Shine.com using valid email and password credentials.

Job Search: Inputs job title, location, and experience details in the search form.

Dynamic Interaction: Handles modal popups (like skill suggestions) and interacts with dynamic web elements smoothly.

Multi-tab Handling: Opens job listings in new tabs and switches control to the active tab for further actions.

Auto-Apply: Automatically clicks the "Apply" button on the second job listing, if available.

Screenshot Support: Captures screenshots after each major step for tracking and debugging (/screenshots folder).

Robust Wait Strategy: Utilizes WebDriverWait to handle dynamic content and improve stability.
